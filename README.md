30 node clusters floating in an invisible container. each cluster contains 3 nodes, and links between the nodes. the lengths of the three links in each cluster correspond to the (1) frequency of an audio signal (between 20 - 5000 hz), (2) cutoff frequency of a moog-like filter, (3) resonance of said moog-like filter.
